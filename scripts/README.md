This folder contains scripts to:
1. calculate the expected total dosage across paralog pairs for tissue and each pair of species, and classify paralog pairs as dosage-constrained and unconstrained.
2. build gene coexpression network across tissue samples and estimate coexpression for paralog pairs within a species.
3. calculate fold-change in expression for paralog pairs within a species.
