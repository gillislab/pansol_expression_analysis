This folder contains one file for each of the 8 tissues sampled in this study. Each file contains a list of paralog pairs with non-zero expression in the tissue, their orthogroup, total expression and fold-change in expression in the tissue. For each tissue, the summed expression of paralog pairs across species is used to estimate the constraint on total dosage on each orthogroup (gene family).
