There are 3 folders with data used in the comparative expression analysis within and across species:
1. expression : this folder has TPM-normalized counts across samples from 22 species and associated sample metadata
2. cross_tissue_expression : this folder has average gene expression across 2 or more tissues for a subset of 15 species
3. total_dosage : this folder has one file per tissue containing paralog pairs from each species with non-zero expression in that tissue. Only orthogroups with exactly two gene copies with non-zero expression in the tissue of interest are listed here.
