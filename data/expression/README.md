This folder has two types of files:

1. {species}_TPM_counts.csv : TPM-normalized counts of tissue samples for each species.

2. pansol_RNAseq_summary.csv : provides tissue of origin and alignment summary stats per sample. Last column in this file indicates whether is sample is retained or excluded from further analysis. Note that this file does not contain QC statistics for tomato expression data since this was generated as a part of another study.
